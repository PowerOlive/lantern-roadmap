# LEP 010 - Updating Lantern Without User Intervention

Date: Apr 2, 2015

Status: Draft

Author: xiam

## Abstract

To ensure users are always using the latest version of Lantern under a
zero-configuration approach it is necessary to have a mechanism that allows
Lantern to update itself without user intervention.

## Proposal

Clients can update themselves by downloading the lantern binary and replacing
the currently installed executable with the new one. They can do this either by
downloading the full binary or an incremental patch. If the client downloads an
incremental patch instead of a full binary the bandwidth cost of a single
client updating will get reduced too.

In order for a client to get access to incremental patches those incremental
patches must be generated by a third party program over the network, an update
server.

The Lantern team already uses Github for publishing version releases, the
update server could use the Github API to get access to such releases, store
them, compute binary differences between releases and provide public URLs for
clients to download the patches.

## Implementation details

### General flow

At some point on the Lantern application's lifetime, an independent process
will be created, this process will periodically send local information (using a
proxy) to a specially crafted server (the update server) that will compare
client's data against a list of releases. When applicable, the server will
generate a binary patch and send a reply to the client containing the URL of
the appropriate patch. The client will download and apply the patch to its
executable file so the new version is ready the next time Lantern starts.

### Update server

The update server holds a list of releases and waits for queries from clients.
Clients will send their own checksum and the server will compare that checksum
against the checksum of the latest release, if they don't match a binary diff
will be generated. This binary diff can be used by the client to patch itself.

The update server may or may not be used as a download server. Clients will
pull binary diffs from this location, the actual patch's URL will be provided
by the update server.

### Lantern client

A client will compute the checksum of its executable file and send it to an
update server periodically. When the update server replies with a special
message meaning that a new version is available, the client will download the
binary patch, apply it to a temporary file and check the signature, if the
signature is what the client expects, the original executable will be replaced
with the patched one.
