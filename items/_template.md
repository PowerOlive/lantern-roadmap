This is a template for making a new roadmap item. Just copy and paste this to a new .md file in the same folder 
(items/) and then fill out the fields. If any fields do not feel relevant then just remove them. 

Be sure to update the main roadmap to link to your item.

Changes to this template are welcome.

### Title of item

(1-2 paragraph overview)

#### Requirements
(ideally user driven, and if not in 'immediate' can include 'nice to haves' that aren't hugely required)

#### Tech research
(any background discussion, links, tech to use, etc)

#### Implementation approach
(what is to be written, what components touched, changes made)

#### Wireframes
(links to any mockups to drive GUI stuff)

#### Discussion
(links to any relevant discussion on lantern-devel. Don't discuss in the roadmap item, discuss on list and
report back here on the consensus path forward and link to the discussion)

#### Tickets
(links to one or more github tickets where the state of this work is tracked

#### Owner
(github name of the person who will lead work on this)
