### Security Audit 

We need to get Lantern audited.

#### Requirements

* Identify auditers and hire them
* Identify the code to be audited. In practice auditing all of Lantern and its subcomponents may be more costly than we can afford, so we need to identify which components make the most sense to audit.
* Add any additional documentation auditer's may require
