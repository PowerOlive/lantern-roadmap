### Non-google logins 

Currently Lantern requires a google account to even use it. We should let people who don't 
have google accounts join. This will require some deep changes, but should lead to a more 
decentralized architecture.

#### Requirements
Easiest place to start would be supporting Mozilla persona. But we should likely extend to
create an architecture that doesn't require as much logging in.


#### LEP

The [Simple Signaling](../lep/Simple_Signaling_DRAFT.md) proposal has some stuff related to the backend
of the changes needed. We likely need at least another proposal for other aspects (like the front end)
as this ends up touching a number of core architecture pieces.
