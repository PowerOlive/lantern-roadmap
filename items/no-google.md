### Non-google logins 

Currently Lantern requires a google account to even use it. We should let people who don't 
have google accounts join. This will require some deep changes, but should lead to a more 
decentralized architecture.

#### Requirements
Easiest place to start would be supporting Mozilla persona. But we should likely extend to
create an architecture that doesn't require as much logging in.
