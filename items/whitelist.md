### Improve whitelist experience 

There are a few low hanging whitelist improvements we could make, like easing the process of 
adding to the whitelist (example browser plugin?) and including whitelist info in our s3 config.

#### Requirements
Make it easy to update the whitelist. Need to talk to more users to get feedback on this. One
idea is a browser plugin, so if you find a site that is blocked you can add it to your whitelist
right there. Could do this in just firefox or chrome, and then let open source contributors 
do other implementations.
