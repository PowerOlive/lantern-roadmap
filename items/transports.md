### Interoperable Transports 

Tor has a pluggable transports API, but the core transports can work just as well with 
Lantern. We need to incorporate more and build a joint community around transports.

#### Requirements

Lantern is already shipping with some pluggable transports from Tor, like FTEProxy. Psiphon also has used
some of the pluggable transports as well. So on the tech
side this is mostly accomplished. But we should build an independent community that lays out in general
what is needed for a pluggable transport, and then what one needs to make a transport work with Tor, Lantern
and Psiphon.
