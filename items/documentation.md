### Better documentation infrastructure 

We are mostly done with migrating documentation to Sphinx. Need to finish it so it's in master, 
live on the website and in transifex.

#### Requirements

This is 90% complete, thanks to Todd Levinson, see http://tlevinson.github.io/lantern/doc/en/user/html/Using-Lantern.html

We need to merge his code in to master, get it set up in an automated build, and link to from the website.

Nice to have's would be getting the markdown pages in transifex and fixing up the CSS to more closely match the website.
