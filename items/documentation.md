### Better documentation infrastructure 

We are mostly done with migrating documentation to Sphinx. Need to finish it so it's in master, 
live on the website and in transifex.

#### Requirements
The majority of this work is already done, with a successful port to sphinx. We just need to get
it all merged and building by default, linked to from the website, and in transifex. A nice
to have would be to have nicer css on the sphinx pages that more closely matches the main lantern
pages.



#### Implementation approach
(what is to be written, what components touched, changes made)

#### Wireframes
(links to any mockups to drive GUI stuff)
