This is a legacy item that never got completed, for what we aimed for 1.1. Many
of the assumptions are still interesting to consider, so saving this for posterity.

### Release 1.1, codename "Dandelion" (1 month - 3 months)

Release 1.1 focuses on growing the Lantern network with the help of diaspora
communities.  We see the diaspora as critical to building the foundation of a
Lantern network that will benefit new censored users by providing them with
live proxies and that will motivate new uncensored users by demonstrating the
vitality and value of Lantern.

Release 1.1 is codenamed "Dandelion" because of that plant's use of diaspores
for self-propagation.  We will refer to members of the diaspora as "diaspores".

#### Dandelion Assumptions

 * Members of the diaspora are already motivated to join the Lantern network and
   run Lantern for personal reasons, and don't need to be sold on this.
 * Members of the diaspora live in the uncensored world (i.e. we are not
   modeling for individuals who have emigrated from one censored region to
   another censored region).
 * Members of the diaspora have connections in the censored world whom they can
   bring onto the Lantern network.
 * Members of the diaspora have connections in the uncensored world whom they
   can bring onto the Lantern network.
 * Some members of the diaspora work for organizations that actively support
   censorship circumvention and are known to and trusted by the Lantern team.
 * Some members of the diaspora work for organizations that are not involved in
   censorship circumvention but that have strong networks back home and might be
   amenable to helping build the Lantern network.
   
#### Network Growth Cycle

We expect the Lantern network to grow in a process somewhat like the following:

 1. Lantern core team member invites diaspore
 2. Diaspore installs Lantern
 3. Diaspore invites friends and family from back home to join Lantern
 4. Diaspore invites other members of diaspora to run Lantern in Give mode 
 5. Friends and family install and run Lantern
 6. Diaspore invites friends in the uncensored world to join Lantern
 7. Friends in uncensored world install Lantern
 8. Friends and family back home connect through friends in the uncensored world
    and are given the opportunity to send a thank you to them
 9. Friends in the uncensored world continue running Lantern
 
Release 1.1 will be successful if it can drive this cycle trough step 9.

Note that the ordering here matters.  Inviting other uncensored diaspora to run
Lantern can happen pretty early, since they are assumed to be motivated to
support Lantern.  However, if friends in the uncensored world are invited too
early (before there's much activity on the network), they won't benefit from
the map visualization and won't get quite the warm fuzzy-feeling they might need
to motivate them to keep Lantern running.

(note) - our overall effort to get uncensored users to keep running Lantern
could be "Keep the Lights On".

#### Key Dandelion Goals

In order to support the above network growth cycle, Dandelion should focus on
the following goals (both technical and process):

 * Make it as easy as possible for diaspora to install Lantern.
 * Make it as easy as possible to invite friends and family back home.
 * Make it as easy as possible for friends and family back home to get up and
   running with Lantern.
 * Give diaspora tools for following up on invitations.
 * Help diaspora support their friends and family back home in using Lantern.
 * Give diaspora tools to generate compelling invitations to friends in the
   uncensored world.
 * Encourage diaspora to invite other give mode users once they have some
   activity from folks back home.
 * Give friends and family back home a way to thank give mode users
 * Reach out to diaspora to get them to use Lantern.
 * Make the process of supporting Lantern as easy as possible for diaspora
   organizations that want to help.
