### Whitelist for Give mode

Many users are excited to share their connection, but not for any possible use. We should give 
users the option to only let their censored proxy buddies access certain sites.

#### Requirements

Should make it easy for give users to run in a mode that only lets people proxy through pre-approved sites. Most 
give users will probably not want to spend lots of time customizing that list, so we should likely make it pretty
easy to keep a 'good' list up to date that most all would use. This seems like it may be one of the biggest challenges
so these lists don't fall behind what censors are blocking.
